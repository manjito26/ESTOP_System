- Form validation with client-side JavaScript

#### 3. Enhanced Flask Application ✅
**File: app/__init__.py** (UPDATED - Lines 174-476)
- Added JSON import for user file management (Line 8)
- 13 new routes added for user and report management:

**User Management Routes:**
- `/user_admin` - Admin-only user administration page
- `/add_user` [POST] - Add new user with name capitalization
- `/delete_user/<username>` [DELETE] - AJAX user deletion

**Report Management Routes:**
- `/reports` - View all reports with filtering
- `/edit_report/<int:report_id>` - Edit/create reports (supervisors/admins only)
- `/save_report` [POST] - Save report changes
- `/view_report/<int:report_id>` - View individual report
- `/report_summary` - Statistics dashboard

**Access Control Implementation:**

- Conditional navigation based on user privileges

#### 5. Name Capitalization Logic ✅
**Implementation Details:**
```javascript
// Function capitalizes first letter, lowercases rest
function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
    return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1).toLowerCase();
}

// Real-time capitalization on input
document.getElementById('firstName').addEventListener('input', function(e) {
    let value = e.target.value;
    if (value.length > 0) {
        e.target.value = capitalizeFirstLetter(value);
    }
});
```

- Applied to both first name and last name fields
- Works on both 'input' and 'blur' events
